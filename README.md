# Talent & Delivery Intelligence Platform (TIP)

> The analytics brain for a staffing / IT-services firm - one place for the numbers that
> actually run the business: consultant utilization & bench time, the
> submission → interview → placement funnel, timesheet & billing health, attrition
> risk, and client health.

TIP ingests data from operational systems (HRMS, ATS, timesheets, CRM), models it in a
lakehouse, and serves it back as **dashboards**, a **predictive ML model**, and an
**"ask your data" AI assistant**. It plugs into the systems a staffing or recruitment
company already runs (HRMS, ATS, timesheets, CRM) so they can run it internally.

> **Status: early-stage scaffold.** This repo currently contains the architecture, the docs,
> the synthetic seed generator, and CI. The per-layer folders are structured but not yet
> built out - see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's next.

## Why this exists

Staffing / IT-services firms make money on people and placements, but the numbers that
decide profit - who's on the bench, how long, which clients are healthy, who's at risk of
leaving - usually live scattered across spreadsheets and separate apps. TIP unifies them and
puts an analytics + AI layer on top.

## What it does (product surface)

- **Dashboards** - utilization & bench, placement funnel, timesheet/billing, client health.
- **Predictive model** - attrition-risk / bench-duration scoring per consultant.
- **Ask your data** - natural-language questions answered over the warehouse (NL→SQL) and
  policy/SOW documents (RAG).

## Tech stack

| Layer | MVP | Production target |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion / transforms | Python, PySpark, dbt | Azure Data Factory + Databricks |
| Lake / warehouse | DuckDB / Postgres | ADLS Gen2 + Synapse / Snowflake |
| Infra | Docker Compose, Terraform | Azure (ADLS, ACR, AKS) |
| API | Python + FastAPI + RBAC | same, containerized |
| Web | React + TypeScript + Vite + Recharts/D3 | same |
| ML | Python, scikit-learn | same, MLflow tracking |
| AI assistant | Python + FastAPI, vector DB | same |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | GitHub Actions |

**Why this stack:** the entire backend (API, ML, AI) is **one language, Python** so it deploys
as one set of containers with one skillset. The frontend is **React + TypeScript** because the
team already knows it and it's the industry default. React also keeps a clean path to a
**mobile app later** via React Native / Expo (same language, shared logic) - the web app is
built responsive so it already works on a phone browser in the meantime.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NexasheOrg/talent-intelligence-platform.git
cd talent-intelligence-platform
python data/seed/generate_seed.py     # create synthetic data to build against
```

Then read the doc for **your** layer's README, and pick up your starter issue.

## Team & ownership

See [`docs/ROLES.md`](docs/ROLES.md). Lead / architect: **Laya**.

## Roadmap

Phased milestones in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md). We ship a thin slice end-to-end
first (one source → one dashboard → one model → one AI query), then widen.
